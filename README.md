## Summary DataFrame Findings
The average number of rides in rural cities is approximately 5 less than in urban cities,
and approximately 13 less than in urban cities.

It was also found urban cities have the lowest fares but more drivers when compared to 
suburban and rural cities. Rural cities have the highest fares and less drivers, which shows
a very close correlation between the three city types when looking at average number of
rides, drivers, and total fares.

## Summary of Line Chart Findings
There is a close fares relationship between the three city types, rural, suburban, and urban,
and activity per month. It is visible urban cities have the higest fares and rural citites
the lowest, while suburban is in the middle range, but they move in relation to their calculated
averages which was also visible when reviewing the data. There was an increase in fares at the
end of February for all city types. Rural and urban cities see a spike again at the beginning of
March, while rural cities spike until the beginnning of April when suburban is down.

Overall, rural cities have the largest fares, less number of rides and drivers, while the opposite
is true for urban cities. Suburban cities are considered the middle range of the three. Despite
these differences, the chart helps us understand the relationship that exists between the three
city types.
